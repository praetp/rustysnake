Keep in mind the main purpose of this project is for me to learn some Rust and make a fun game for my daughter..

# Bug reports and feature requests
If you find a bug or want to submit a feature request, you are most welcome. 
However, as this is a hobby project of mine, I cannot make any commitments to what extent I will make any efforts to your request.
I am definitely interested in any feedback that can improve my command of the Rust programming language.
